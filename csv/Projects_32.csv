The scheme area is situated at the south North western part of Idukki district of Kerala. These areas are socially and economically in a fast developing stage. Growth of population as well as the higher living standard has increased the demand of water in this area to a great extent. The area is drought affected and acute water scarcity is being faced during summer. The existing water supply schemes to these areas are inadequate. Hence it is very much necessary to implement sustainable WSS to these panchayats.

76316375,The existing 11kV line from Boundry to Malayinchi via Alkallu transformer under Electrical section Karimannoor is passing through the highly vegetated area and causing more interruption and very difficult to patrol the line through hilly and vegetated area. And also this area is very hilly terrain and very difficult to restore power supply during night and in  rainy season.  To avoid these difficulties it is proposed to re route this line through the PWD Road using ABC cable . There are 817 connections and about 2000 people including thousands of students living in this area and it is very difficult to give uninterrupted power supply . Due to this more complaints received from people and local authorities from there. Hence it is decided to rerouting this line through Boundry – Malayinchi road by Board’s own fund during 2024-25. The Project amount comes to Rs. 10252294/-. As the proposal  is by drawing 4.8KM ABC(Ariel Bunched Cable) instead of bare overhead line .,New,FP/KL/TRANS/481002/2024,2024-06-13T11:47:27.685+00:00,,DELISTED_BY_SYSTEM,1.152,13011934.0,KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD LTD,,Forest clearance form,,,,Re-routing of existing 11kV line from Boundry to Malayinchi via Alkallu Transformer at Electrical Section Karimannoor,KERALA,Thodupuzha,UDUMBANNUR,,,61/1C,Linear,0.324,0.828,1.152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,Not applicable as the project or activity is site specific,,NO,NO,NO,2024-06-29T09:06:29.029+00:00,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assistant Engineer, Electrical Section, Vannappuram",Thodupuzha,32,"State PSU (eg.

106107838,"The 11 KV Achankovil feeder from the Thenmala 66 KV substation reaches Achankovil via Ayyappankana, Nagamala, Kuravanthavalam, and Priya Estate. The line from Ayyappankana to Nagamala passes through a reserve forest area where wild animals roam freely. It is common for elephants to knock down trees and disrupt the power supply. There have also been incidents of falling trees and snapping live conductors, posing a danger to wild animals. Moreover, it is very difficult and dangerous to locate and resolve power outages that occur at night.
Therefore, this project has been prepared to eliminate the existing overhead power line (aerial line) from Thenmala Ayyappankana to Nagamala Bungalow and instead lay an underground cable through the forest path along this route. This will minimize power interruptions of the T feeder, reduce electrical accidents, and enable an uninterrupted power supply.

Development of the Port of Beypore is proposed as part of the Sagarmala Project to improve the port facilities with an intention to attract more coastal traffic volume to the port. As per the traffic study undertaken, the present low level of cargo throughput at Beypore port is due to inadequate facilities at the port, more particularly the channel depth. Water depth available in the channels, turning circle and harbor basin is not adequate for the navigation of 6.0m draft vessels. The present proposal is for the development of two new coastal berths/wharfs, undertaking capital dredging for providing adequate depth in the channels, turning circle and harbor basin for navigation, maneuvering and berthing upto 10 m depth in three phases.

It is important to note that the proposed area of 1.6067 hectares lies entirely 
within the originally approved 4.685 hectares, as substantiated by the survey map No. 4676/18(1).
