Besides, there has been tremendous increase in population as well as living standard of public which has resulted in additional load on the existing system. The old scheme for the area is outlived and the pipe network is deteriorated, thereby leading to water losses at number of spots. Moreover, the area is mostly populated by Gujars who are sparsely scattered over the patis having huge contour difference. The off take point of the scheme is at Tatjen nallah which is nearly 15kms away in deep forests of Sedew where snow depths is nearly 8feet and its maintenance during times of disruption is problematic.
