As the habitation in Hanspuri village was established during early Sixties. Now it has a population of about 700 people. Although the village is connected by land; in the absence of any road the villagers depend on Dinghi (country boat) to reach Mayabunder the District Head Quarter. The journey by sea takes about 3 – 4 hrs depending on tidal and weather conditions. During the month of June to November when the sea remains rough the villagers face much difficulty and the only option of connectivity is the katcha path from Hanspuri to Bajota through very dense jungle and to have walk for 5 hrs to reach Bajota and from Bajota to Mayabunder by Bus. ;The proposal is for a new road connecting Hanspuri to Bajota. The proposed alignment of the road passes through Reserve Forest.  ;;;,37371.0
