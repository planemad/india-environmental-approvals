Due to the topographic constraints of the area, geometric considerations (alignment and gradient) of the proposed tunnel, and engineering feasibility, this option is the most feasible one.

89522810,The Govt of Himachal Pradesh has issued an intention notification vide letter No. FFE-B-F(6)11/2005 dated 28-07-2010 regarding merger of Sainj Wildlife Sanctuary in Great Himalayan National Park. In view of the decision of World Heritage Committee/conference UNESCO 38th session held at Doha on 23-06-2014.

Now, the project proponent has proposed expansion by upgrading the existing Induction furnace of capacity 8 TPH to 15 TPH & merging the Rolling Mill unit (M/s Shree Siddi Vinayak TOR Pvt. Ltd.). However, 12 TPH Induction Furnace will remain same.
Thus, after expansion, the overall production capacity of the industrial unit will become 1,20,000 TPA of TMT Bars with 2 Induction Furnaces of capacity 12 TPH & 15 TPH and existing Rolling Mill.
