Gore -PP-Girdhar-Chotak road listed in LTRoWP srl No.257.  The proposed NHSL which has been approved as per AWP target 2025-26 will drastically cut down the travelling time and improve the operational and logistical support to these high altitude locations thereby significantly enhancing the operational capability.
